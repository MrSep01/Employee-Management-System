# Employee Management System

## Introduction üìö

The Employee Management System is a robust and interactive application designed to streamline the management of employee data within an organization. This application offers a user-friendly command line interface to view, add, update, and delete employee-related information, encapsulating the essential aspects of effective data management and organization hierarchy.

## Project Overview üåê

The core objective of this project is to provide a simplified, yet comprehensive, interface for managing various aspects of employee data, departments, roles, and budgets within a designated database structure.

### Objectives üéØ

- Interactive CLI interface facilitating ease of navigation and data manipulation.
- Efficient data retrieval and modification for departments, roles, and employees.
- Real-time budget analysis for different departments.
- Structured database schema ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## SQL Classes Defined üß©

The project incorporates a class `SqlFunctions` to encapsulate the SQL operations required for interacting with the database. This class provides methods to execute a variety of SQL queries to manage and retrieve data.

## Development Process üíª

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis

Identify the requirements for data management, such as:

- Data attributes for employees, roles, and departments.
- Necessary operations like viewing, adding, updating, and deleting records.

### Step 2: Database Design

Designing the database schema to accommodate the data structures for employees, roles, and departments while ensuring referential integrity.

### Step 3: Coding the Solution

Key components developed:

- **`main`:** The main function to handle user interactions through a series of prompts.
- **`SqlFunctions`:** A class to encapsulate SQL operations and provide asynchronous query execution.

### Step 4: Testing & Debugging

Ensure all functionality works as expected, and the database interactions are handled gracefully.

## Code Breakdown üß†

### Main Function: `main`

- **User Input:** Utilizes `inquirer` to prompt the user for actions and inputs.
- **Action Handling:** Based on user's action, relevant methods of `SqlFunctions` class are invoked to execute corresponding database operations.

### SQL Functions Class: `SqlFunctions`

- **Asynchronous Query Execution:** Provides a method `queryAsync` for executing SQL queries asynchronously.
- **Data Management Methods:** Includes a variety of methods to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for departments, roles, and employees.



## How to Use the Project üñ•Ô∏è

8. Launch MySQL by entering the following command in your terminal: 

 `

   mysql -u root -p


9. When prompted, enter your MySQL password.
10. Once logged into MySQL, execute the following commands to set up the database and seed it with initial data:


source schema.sql;

source seeds.sql;

11. Quit and navigate back to the Main directory 
12. Run the application by executing the command:
 
 npm start

13. Follow the prompts to interact with the employee management system.
